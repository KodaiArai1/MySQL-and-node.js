# MySQL-and-node.js
This project uses MySQL to create a database with fake entries that is connected to a simple webpage where people can enter details which gets added onto the database. 

Here are the steps I took:

[Creating an empty database](https://github.com/KodaiKonnerArai/MySQL-and-node.js/blob/main/Schema.sql)

[Adding fake users into the database](https://github.com/KodaiKonnerArai/MySQL-and-node.js/blob/main/Fake%20Data%20Input.js)

[Code to setup link with webpage and database](https://github.com/KodaiKonnerArai/MySQL-and-node.js/blob/main/Node%20Code.js)

[Creating a simple layout](https://github.com/KodaiKonnerArai/MySQL-and-node.js/blob/main/Home%20Page%20Layout.ejs) and [formating the layout of the webpage](https://github.com/KodaiKonnerArai/MySQL-and-node.js/blob/main/Home%20Page%20Format.css)
