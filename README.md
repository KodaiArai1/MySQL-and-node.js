# MySQL-and-node.js
This project uses MySQL to create a database with fake entries that is connected to a simple webpage where people can enter details which gets added onto the database. 

Here are the steps I took:

1. [Creating an empty database](https://github.com/KodaiKonnerArai/MySQL-and-node.js/blob/main/Schema.sql)

2. [Adding fake users into the database](https://github.com/KodaiKonnerArai/MySQL-and-node.js/blob/main/Fake%20Data%20Input.js)

3. [Code to setup link with webpage and database](https://github.com/KodaiKonnerArai/MySQL-and-node.js/blob/main/Node%20Code.js)

4. [Creating a simple layout](https://github.com/KodaiKonnerArai/MySQL-and-node.js/blob/main/Home%20Page%20Layout.ejs) and [formating the layout of the webpage](https://github.com/KodaiKonnerArai/MySQL-and-node.js/blob/main/Home%20Page%20Format.css)

Here is a [preview](https://github.com/KodaiKonnerArai/MySQL-and-node.js/blob/main/Webpage%20Preview%201.png) of the webpage. 

This projects primarily focsing on the use of MySQL and Node with little experience in Java.
